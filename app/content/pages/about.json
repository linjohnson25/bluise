  "content": "I am a builder, a leader, an achiever, and a team player. \n\n I love building software products that elevate every-day experiences and help people effortlessly accomplish their goals. \n\n My product background spans software platforms in market research and consumer insights tech (subscription-based SaaS consumer products) to health technology (clinical platforms, internal tooling, enterprise software).\n\nOutside of work, I am an over-involved dog mom 🐶, a washed up basketball-er 🏀, and a mediocre music-maker 🎸."
